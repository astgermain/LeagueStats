# LeagueStats


# - Milestone 1 -
## -- Proposal --
#### I propose to create an iOS app that makes use of the Riot API, https://developer.riotgames.com/, which is used to access game data for the popular game League of Legends, and create an app that tracks live game data including scores, items, kill/death/assist rations, and more. In addition, I am also considering features such as server status, item build stat tracking, profile search, and possibly game analysis. I will be using LeagueAPI found in CocoaPods which is the most current pod I can find available.

## --- Must Have Features ---
#### Depending on the difficulty I want to implement both or 1 or these 2 features
#### 1) View live-game stats of teammates and opponents with easy views of rank, win rate, kda, runes, and summoners. Approx 30-60 hours to complete(ballpark estimate)
#### 2) View item stats and abilities and create item sets that track the combined stats of the selected build and be able to save locally. Approx 40-70 hours(extreme estimate)

## --- Nice-to-have Features ---
#### These features will only be implemented with consideration to easy of deployment, utility, and time left after must-have feature(s)
#### 1) Server Status check, for when game is down or other issues occur Apporx 15 hours
#### 2) Profile search to look up users and view their stats and game data. Approx 30 hours
#### 3) Game analysis which takes individual matchs from a players match history and examines stats such as damage dealt, gold earned, and more. Approx 30 hours

***NOTE: Appoximations are extremely estimated***
